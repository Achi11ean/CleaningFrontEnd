I am a working, homeschooling mother and wife who just doesnâ€™t have the time to clean as much as Iâ€™d like. Treating myself to this deep clean was the best decision ever! You will not be sorry!!",

        "I have been using A Breath of Fresh Air cleaning service for nearly a year. They are courteous, professional and punctual. They come into the house in an unobtrusive manner allowing me to continue to work from home while they are here. The owner is a good communicator and is reasonable with me regarding my expectations. They are flexible to my evolving needs and offer support and suggestions whenever possible. I plan to use them as long as possible.",

Every surface was spotless, and there were no harsh chemical smells. They truly care about their clients and their pets.

The attention to detail was outstanding, and the house feels so fresh and welcoming now. From the initial consultation, Amanda was thorough, professional, and incredibly kind. She even took the time to chat with my curious toddler, who had a million questions for her! Thank you so much for your hard work!",
